# Dashboard for WinForms - How to use Window Functions in Calculated Fields

Our dashboard has the built-in [Window Calculations](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116917/common-features/advanced-analytics/window-calculations?p=netframework) functionality and you can use [predefined patterns](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115920/common-features/advanced-analytics/window-calculations/creating-window-calculations) (including custom expressions) to define the *window calculation* for a certain [Measure](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116523/basic-concepts-and-terminology/measures-and-dimensions?p=netframework) field.

However, there are certain usage scenarios when you wish to use some *window function* (see the corresponding subsection in the [Functions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400122/common-features/advanced-analytics/expression-constants-operators-and-functions#functions) help section) in the context of the [Calculated Field](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116934/common-features/advanced-analytics/calculated-fields?p=netframework). For example, you may wish to perform complex calculation and combine several calculated fields. Since there is no way to include *window function* in the *calculated field* directly, the solution is to use the [w-Function](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/401421/common-features/advanced-analytics/aggregations/w-function-aggregation-intermediate-level?p=netframework).

This example illustrates how to emulate the standard [Percent of Total](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115920/common-features/advanced-analytics/window-calculations/creating-window-calculations#percent-of-total) calculation behavior. For this the *calculated field* with the following expression is defined:

`ToDouble(Sum([Sales])) / w(Total(Sum([Sales])), partitionBy(), orderBy())`

The second part of this expression uses the *w-Function* with the embedded *window function* (`Total` in this example) to calculate the total Sales summary for the entire aggregated data collection. The current row summary is divided by this total to obtain the percentage. In addition, the *Percent* [formatting](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15697/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/data-shaping/formatting-data) is applied.
