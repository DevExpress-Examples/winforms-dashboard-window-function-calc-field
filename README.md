# Dashboard for WinForms - How to Use Window Functions in Calculated Fields

This example emulates the standard [Percent of Total](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/115920/common-features/advanced-analytics/window-calculations/creating-window-calculations#percent-of-total) window calculation behavior in the calculated field's expression.

You cannot include the [window functions](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/400122/common-features/advanced-analytics/expression-constants-operators-and-functions#functions) in a [calculated field](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/116934/common-features/advanced-analytics/calculated-fields) directly. To support window functions inside a calculated field expression, use the [w-Function](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/401421/common-features/advanced-analytics/aggregations/w-function-aggregation-intermediate-level).

This example contains the calculated field with the following expression:

`ToDouble(Sum([Sales])) / w(Total(Sum([Sales])), partitionBy(), orderBy())`

The second part of this expression uses the *w-Function* with the embedded *window function* (`Total` in this example) to calculate the total Sales summary for the entire aggregated data collection. The current row summary is divided by this total to obtain the percentage. In addition, the *Percent* [formatting](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/15697/winforms-dashboard/winforms-designer/create-dashboards-in-the-winforms-designer/data-shaping/formatting-data) is applied.
